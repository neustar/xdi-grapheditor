                <h1>Mouse Functions</h1>
                With your mouse, you can do the following:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Left-click</b>: Select & Drag a new node.</li>
                    <li><b>Shift + Click on Canvas</b>: Create a new node.</li>
                    <li><b>Shift + Drag</b> from one node towards another: Add a link between the 2 nodes.</li>
                    <li><b>Double-click</b> a node: Fold the subtree of the node.</li>
                </ol>            
                <h1>Node related keys</h1>
                Once a node is selected (by clicking once on it), the following keys are enabled:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>R</b>: Switch a node's type to <i>Root</i>. Note that <i>common</i> or <i>inner</i> roots are not distinguished. If the selected node was already of <i>Root</i> type, it will be changed back to <i>Context</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>F</b>: Fix/Unfix the movement of a node.</li>
                    <li><b>Enter</b>: Rename the node.</li>
                    <li><b>Delete/Backspace</b>: Delete the node along with all attached links.</li>
                </ol>
                <h1>Link related keys</h1>
                Once a link is selected (by clicking once on it), the following keys are enabled:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>R</b>: Switch a link's type to <i>Relationship</i>. If the selected link was already of <i>Relational</i> type, it will be changed back to <i>Context</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>L</b>: Inverse a link's direction.</li>
                    <li><b>Enter</b>: Rename the link.</li>
                    <li><b>Delete/Backspace</b>: Delete the link.</li>
                </ol>
                <h1>Viewport Control</h1>
                Press and hold option/alt key, you can do the following:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Drag</b>: Pan the viewport.</li>
                    <li><b>Scroll</b> Mouse wheel: Scale the viewport.</li>
                </ol>
                A navigator at the bottom right indicates the size and position of viewport.
                <h1>Search</h1>
                There is a search bar at the top right. You can perform keyword search on nodes and links:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Make a query</b>: Click on the search bar and type your query. The results will be listed and updated as you are typing.</li>
                    <li><b>Browse Results</b>: The names of matches are listed. The lists are scrollable. All matches are highlighted in the graph.</li>
                    <li><b>See it in graph</b>: Click on an item and the view will pan and zoom to the node or link. </li>
                    <li><b>Done</b>: Click on done to hide the list.</li>

                <h1>Tutorial</h1>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                This page walks you through a few steps to create a simple graph and illustrate some of the major features of this tool.
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                Please execute the following steps:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Step 1 - Creating a minimal graph by importing an XDI statement</b><br>
                        To do so, click on the "Import XDI" button and enter the following line: <code>[=]!:uuid:1111/$is$ref/=alice</code><br>
                        Click the "Graph It" button and you will see a graph with 4 nodes and 4 links.<br>
                        Some things worth noting on the generated graph:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The node with the orange stroke is the common root.</li>
                            <li>The dotted red line is a relational statement. The grey ones are contextual statements.</li>
                            <li>Edges are labeled in blue while nodes are labeled in black.</li>
                        </ol>
                        Note that you may enter many XDI single display line statements at once
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Step 2 - Moving nodes around</b><br>
                        Press the Shift key, select a node (any node) and drag it around.<br>
                        You'll see it turn to red to indicate that its position is now fixed (or limited in movement).
                        To release the node (i.e. allow it to move freely within the overall simulation) double click on the node.
                        Doing so, will return the node's colour to grey (note: the colour change is buggy at the moment).
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Step 3 - Add a few contextual nodes</b><br>
                        Click in the window (away from any node or link).<br>
                        A window appears to enter the node's label. Enter <i>=bob</i> (or another context node label).<br>
                        Create another node labeled <i>=bob<#email></i>.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Step 4 - Link 2 nodes</b><br>
                        Fix the <i>=bob</i> node by clicking once on it. Do the same on the <i>=bob<#email></i> node.<br>
                        Fixing those nodes will make the linking easier (this is not required though).<br>
                        Now that the nodes are fixed, you can place them anywhere you want by Shift-Click & Drag them.<br>
                        Click & drag the <i>=bob</i> node to the <i>=bob<#email></i> node.<br>
                        After releasing it, a new link appears between the 2 nodes. Notice that the label of the link is automatically inferred from the nodes labels.
                        To confirm the link, simply click on one of the nodes.<br>
                        For consistency, link the common root node to the <i>=bob</i> node.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Step 5 - Add a literal statement</b><br>
                        Create a new node labeled <i>"bob@email.biz"</i>.<br>
                        Link the <i>=bob<#email></i> node to this node.<br>
                        You'll see an intermediary node is automatically created and both links with proper <i>&</i> labels added.
                        Also note that the <i>"bob@email.biz"</i> node is now a literal node (green stroke).
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Step 6 - Add a relational statement</b><br>
                        Link the <i>=alice</i> node to the <i>=bob></i> node but before clicking on a node
                        (i.e. while the link is still a dashed line) press the "R" key.<br>
                        You'll see the link turn to a red dashed line: this is a relational arc.
                    </li><br>
